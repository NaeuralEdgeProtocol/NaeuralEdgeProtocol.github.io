# Introduction

Naeural Edge Protocol (Naeural for short) is the Operating System for Artificial Intelligence powered by AI and Blockchain technologies. Our mission at Naeural is to democratize AI by establishing a network of shared resources, simplifying the development and deployment of AI applications from inception to execution. Naeural empowers anyone to access and capitalize on AI's potential through an extensive array of applications hosted within our user-friendly ecosystem, driving revenue for active participants. With our “AI power to the people'' motto, we envision a future in which computers and mobile devices worldwide provide AI solutions for a range of tasks and projects which matter to individuals, large and small organizations alike.

Naeural aims to address key technical and economic challenges by offering readily accessible AI solutions that are cost-effective through trustless micro-transactions. This approach eliminates barriers to entry, as it only requires consumer or retail computer devices equipped with the Naeural software. Our solution caters to the requirements of developers, compute providers, and individuals without extensive AI expertise, ensuring widespread accessibility and usability.

Our project ecosystem will establish a utility blockchain network wherein AI processing nodes will:

- Collaborate to execute tasks aligned with real-life use cases;
- Generate revenue for the node owners who contribute services to the network;
- Directly generate income for participants in the service provider network, including developers, maintainers, and other stakeholders.

# The cutting edge of AI & Blockchain

Our **Naeural** initiative, as outlined in our [foundational paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08708), spearheads the democratization of AI through the implementation of a **Decentralized Neuro-symbolic Autonomous** processing framework, abbreviated as **Naeural DNA**. This innovative framework seamlessly integrates various data sources, facilitating the swift deployment of business rules via user-friendly low-code and no-code interfaces. Supported by its own SDKs/APIs for expedited application development, it harnesses the vast capabilities of Large Language Models.

Naeural introduces multi-domain Large Language Model (LLM) based applications within the Naeural DNA framework. This breakthrough enables the creation of versatile applications featuring various functionalities such as time series predictive analytics, zero-shot-training for anomaly detection, and video scene analysis without the need for training. These applications leverage state-of-the-art foundational models and are designed for effortless development, requiring no deployment or maintenance. Operating within a decentralized, token-based framework for budgeting and scalability, this fusion of advanced AI capabilities and decentralized processes positions Naeural as a catalyst for transformation in the AI landscape. By simplifying development and deployment, Naeural paves the way for a future where AI is accessible and seamlessly integrated into every facet of digital innovation.

Naeural stands at the forefront of economic and operational efficiency by incorporating a token-based system designed for intelligent budgeting and scaling. The platform seamlessly interfaces with web3 and the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**, facilitating smooth blockchain interactions. Leveraging IoT-based protocols such as MQTT, Naeural enhances security through signature-based validation and capitalizes on blockchain's inherent immutability, thereby ensuring dependable and secure operations within a trustless infrastructure.

The Naeural vision aligns seamlessly with ongoing digital transformation trends, aiming to convert computing devices into lucrative assets through a trustless model of shared processing power. This forward-looking approach not only provides incentives for device owners but also contributes to reducing the AI industry's carbon footprint. Through resource optimization, Naeural significantly reduces the time required to launch AI-powered applications, thereby fostering a more sustainable and economically viable AI ecosystem.

# Fast app development & go-to-market

Naeural's revolutionary architecture is characterized by five key features that expedite the development and deployment of AI in everyday applications:

1. **Template-Based Ready-to-Use Infrastructure** - Offering pre-designed software and compute infrastructure templates tailored for various applications such as commercial safety & security, Smart City solutions, and blockchain gaming.

2. **Optimized Decentralized Edge Node Grid** - Service providers furnish a highly efficient grid of decentralized edge nodes capable of boosting compute power, where one **Neural Edge Node (NEN)** represents one instance of the Naeural software installed on a device. For example, a grid of 16 Nvidia A100-80 GPUs can be simulated by 100-150 nodes installed on consumer-grade GPU computers like game consoles or mobile workstations.

3. **Flexible Consumer Deployment** - End consumers have the flexibility to deploy their workloads on nearby network nodes, either free of charge or at reduced rates.

4. **Transparent Pay-as-You-Go Model** - Processing fees are automatically calculated, distributed in a trustless fashion, and transparently recorded using blockchain ledger technology.

5. **Seamless Legacy and New Application Integration** - Legacy-based applications and outdated software systems can be seamlessly integrated by forking base functionalities, while new applications can utilize plugin-based execution pipelines with readily available APIs and documentation.

Regardless of your project's scope or your team's expertise, Naeural is designed to accelerate your project's launch, catering not only to AI projects but also to a diverse range of needs. For instance, if you require a horizontally scalable web-API with multiple endpoints, devoid of MQTT, AI, or blockchain integration, you can effortlessly set up endpoints using low-code and deploy a fleet of heterogeneous distributed microservices via our `ngrok` integration.

# Tokenomics

The tokenomics of the Naeural Edge Protocol are are meticulously designed to enhance the ecosystem's durability and expansion. As a core **utility ERC-20 token**, the Naeural Edge Protocol token functions as the principal currency facilitating transactions throughout the network. This tokenomics framework aims to reward all ecosystem contributors — developers, node operators, and users alike — encouraging active participation and sustained growth.

Since the Naeural Edge Protocol token operates as a utility token rather than a security token, its primary function lies in facilitating operational activities within the Naeural ecosystem, rather than speculative trading. It empowers users to contribute computing power, access diverse services, deploy applications, and eventually partake in governance processes. Consequently, there has not been, nor is there any intention for, a **Token Generation Event (TGE)** or **Initial Coin/Token Offering (ICO/IDO)** associated with the Naeural Edge Protocol token. All tokens, including those held in the Foundation's treasury, are distributed through **Naeural Edge Node (NEN) licenses** (Node Deeds) and the Naeural Edge Protocol decentralized application (dApp). These Node Deeds come in three forms: **Genesys Node Deed (GND)**, **Master Node Deed (MND)**, and **Node Deed (ND)**."

## Genesys Node Deed (GND)
A singular issuance exclusive to the **Naeural Edge Protocol Foundation**, the **Genesys Node Deed (GND)** activates the "edge node zero," the Foundation's virtual compute node. This activation is crucial for generating tokens allocated to the publicly disclosed Foundation token pools detailed further below. Essentially, the GND serves as the catalyst for initiating the entire Naeural Edge Protocol ecosystem.

## Master Node Deed (MND)
A specialized node license that will be allocated to both the development team and initial investors. This deed plays a pivotal role in supporting and sustaining the core functions of the ecosystem. The emission period for MND spans over a duration of more than 36 months.

## Node Deed (ND)
The license available for public purchase which enables the operation of individual edge nodes within the Naeural Edge Protocol ecosystem. These nodes are crucial for powering and maintaining the network's decentralized infrastructure. Unlike the emission strategy for MNDs, NDs are emitted at a faster rate, ensuring a prolonged vesting period.


# The Naeural Edge Protocol Treasury

The Naeural Edge Protocol treasury encompasses multiple pools designed to delineate the scope of resource allocation.
